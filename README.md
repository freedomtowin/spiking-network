# spiking-network

Since I am hitting my popular technology quota, I decided to also post about Spiking Networks. From my cloud-automated stock data collection project, I now have over a thousand rows of open-market hourly data. [You can see the processed data in the repo].

I've found that small market fluxuations are fairly easy to predict, but its much harder to predict the profitable price swings.
